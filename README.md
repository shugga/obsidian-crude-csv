> [!TIP]
>
> **Opening CSV Files**
>
> - Click on a `.csv` file in your vault
>   - it will automatically opens the file in the spreadsheet view
>
> **Create a new CSV File**
>
> - Use or right click the **file explorer**, choose **Ribon icon** or the **command palette** to create a new CSV file in your vault
>   - it will automatically opens the file in the spreadsheet view
>
> **Use a Table template**
>
> - Exits a `template.csv` in your Template-Folder (Core plugin or Templater) it will be used as scheme for new files
> - _You can also set one in the plugin settings_
>   - if not found, exists nor set, new files got a "mini content"
>     - MINI = 1st row with A, B and a 2nd row with 1, 2
>
> **Editing Data**
>
> - **Edit**: Click on a cell to edit
> - **Add/Remove**: Use the toolbar buttons to add/del rows or columns as needed
>
> **Toolbar**
>
> - `+R` - Add a new row at the bottom of the table
> - `-R` - Remove the last row from the table
> - `+C` - Add a new column to the right
> - `-C` - Remove the rightmost column
> - _Prevention from deleting all cells and having an empty file - 1 cell is minimum and still remains_
